## Abstract

This study applies machine learning (ML) approaches to predict Lyme
disease dissemination phenotypes from Borrelia burgdorferi protein
sequences. Using whole genome data from 299 clinical isolates, we
identified specific amino acid residues in surface-exposed virulence
factors that distinguish between localized and disseminated infections.
Our computational framework achieved robust predictive performance
(\>0.7 for all metrics) for three key proteins (DbpA, OspC, and RevA)
and revealed that ML-identified residues are significantly enriched in
predicted B-cell epitope regions, suggesting their role in immune
evasion and bacterial persistence
